 * The distance between two vectors will be low (near 0), if their attribute
 * values are dimension-wise strictly positively correlated, it will be high
 * (near 2), if their attribute values are dimension-wise strictly negatively
 * correlated. For Features with uncorrelated attributes, the distance value
 * will be intermediate (around 1).
 * 
 * This variation is for weighted dimensions.
